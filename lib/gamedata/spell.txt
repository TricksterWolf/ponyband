# File: spell.txt

# This file is used to initialize the "player spell" information for Angband.
# Change: level, mana, fail, and exp are determined by class, not by spell.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# Format:
# name:name
# realm:spell realm
# effect:effect:parameter (if needed):parameter (if needed)
# param:parameter:parameter (if needed)
# dice:dice string
# expr:dice expression
# desc: description

# 'name' is the name used as a lookup for the spell (by class)

# 'realm' is the spell realm

# 'effect' defines the spell effect (as listed in src/list-effects.h), along
# with up to two effect parameters if needed

# 'param' defines an extra one or two effect parameters if needed

# 'dice' provides a random value to be used by an effect (for damage,
# healing, etc).  As well as the normal random value fields described above,
# it can contain expressions like $B, which refer forward to an 'expr' line.

# 'expr' provides an expression for use in effect dice.  It consists of a
# code letter (eg B) for the expression, a base function to use (for example
# PLAYER_LEVEL), and a sequence of operations to perform on that base.

# 'desc' is for description. As many desc: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the spell. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
# together.
